# Ringtools-Web

**Note: **Installing ringtools-web on your own node at this moment requires some experience with the command-line. This will be improved in the near future. You can also use the public version on [https://ringtools.djuri.nl/](https://ringtools.djuri.nl)

See the [ringtools-web documentation](https://dsbaars.gitbook.io/ringtools-web/basic-usage) for basic usage.
